## ABSTRACT

Chatbots are regularly used to add to the user experience on many websites,
social media apps and mobile devices.
These bots are used to faster access for the information.
Taking care of one's mental health is important nowadays when
social media creates echo chambers, causes fear of missing out and other issues.
We propose a discord bot that keeps track of people going through a tough time
using machine learning. Along with this functionality, this bot aims to provide
web search using different search engines, detecting emotion 
using machine learning and displaying weather information.

## OBJECTIVES

- Fetching and displaying of weather
- Web Search

  - (Like providing help to people sending angry or sad messages)

- Specific purpose bots like music bots that dont have all the above features
- Voice assistants that are clunky to use

## DISADVANTAGES

- Some of these can be slow to work and do not have enough configuration options
- Bots do not participate in improving emotional aspect of chatting on
  a social media platform
